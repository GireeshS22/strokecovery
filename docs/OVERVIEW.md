# Strokecovery - Application Overview

## What is Strokecovery?

Strokecovery is a mobile companion app for patients recovering from stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). It helps survivors and their caregivers manage the long recovery journey through daily tracking, medication management, educational content, and community support.

## Problem Statement

Stroke recovery is a long and overwhelming process (months to years). After hospital discharge, patients and families often feel lost:

- **Medication complexity** — Multiple medications with different schedules
- **Therapy tracking** — Physiotherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy sessions to manage
- **Symptom monitoring** — New ailments and recovery patterns are hard to track
- **Emotional isolation** — Survivors often feel alone in their journey
- **Information gaps** — Lack of accessible, daily education about recovery

## Target Users

### Primary Users

| User Type | Description | Key Needs |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Stroke Survivors** | Adults recovering from ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke | Medication reminders, therapy tracking, emotional support |
| **TBI Patients** | Individuals recovering from traumatic brain injury | Similar needs, cognitive exercise support |
| **Caregivers** | Family members, spouses, children of survivors | Monitor progress, coordinate care, manage their own burnout |

### User Characteristics

- **Age range:** Primarily 45-75 years (stroke), 20-50 years (TBI)
- **Tech comfort:** Variable — app must be extremely simple
- **Physical limitations:** May have motor impairments, vision issues, cognitive difficulties
- **Emotional state:** Often frustrated, anxious, or depressed

## Value Proposition

### For Patients
> "Your daily companion through stroke recovery — never miss a medication, track your progress, and connect with others who understand."

### For Caregivers
> "Stay informed about your loved one's recovery without being intrusive — coordinate care with confidence."

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity first** — Every feature must be usable with one hand, poor vision, or cognitive fog
2. **Daily value** — Users should have a reason to open the app every day
3. **Empathy-driven** — Celebrate small wins, never shame missed goals
4. **Privacy-respecting** — Health data stays secure and under user control
